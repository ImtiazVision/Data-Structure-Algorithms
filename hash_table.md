Hash Tables are a critical idea in the world of Data Structures and Algorithms. Hashing is a technique for storing an item using a unique key. This implies that hashing always results in the creation of a key-value pair. A collection of such pairings constitutes a dictionary, in which each object or value may be located by its key.
