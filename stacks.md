### Stacks 

**Stacks** : are ordered according to the Last in First Out principle. This indicates that the element added last is the one at the top, and the one added first is the one at the bottom.

A stack of books is a real-world example of Stacks. To retrieve the book in the center, we'll need to remove all the books stacked on top of it. Additionally, the book that was most recently added to the stack is always at the top.
