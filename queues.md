The fundamental difference between a stack and a queue is that instead of employing the LIFO principle (Last in, First Out), a queue uses the FIFO principle (First in, First Out). The first element entered is the one that comes out first, according to FIFO. A queue may be compared as a pipe with both ends open. Elements enter at one end and exit at the other.
