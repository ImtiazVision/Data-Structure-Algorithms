### Tree Traversal

**Tree Traversal** : The practice of visiting (checking or updating) each node in a tree data structure precisely once is known as tree traversal. Unlike linked lists and one-dimensional arrays, which can only be traversed in linear order, trees may be traversed in a variety of ways. They may be traversed in either depth-first or breadth-first order.
